      <h2>The CleanStroke Paint pen</h2>
      <p>Introducing The CleanStroke Paint pen, the ultimate multifunctional 
        paint brush designed for both professionals and DIY enthusiasts.It reduces mess and is easy to carry,
        if you are travelling just get a notebook and pick up The CleanStroke Paint pen  and you are good to go.
        Traditional painting—whether for kids, hobbyists, or DIYers—is messy, inconvenient, and often wasteful. 
        Spilled water, dried-up brushes, and scattered supplies make the experience frustrating.</p>
        <p>Introduction — Built By Us, For Kids Like Us
        Hi! We are a group of young innovators who love to create without the mess.
        As students ourselves, we noticed a big problem: art time often turns into clean-up time. Paint spills, water drips, and missing brushes make it hard to just enjoy the fun part—painting!
        That's why we created something different. Something smarter. Something designed from the mind of a curious 5-year-old to the hands of every young creator.
